What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

 I did not have experience to **create** repo since I folked the folder during week 1 lesson. Even after wrote a reveiw I was still struggle with that.


What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

    Also I during week1 I was still not sure about clone. But now it is more clear that *clone* is making a cpoy to "Local" 


What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I do not think I asked her much I asked small question about usig help inside terminal but most of mu question my pair helped me so I needed not to ask her really.


What still confuses you about Git?

* Iside which folder or which level should I make branch. 
* After merge the branch should I remove the files?  * Should I merge branch to master or master to branch. 
* Also the conflict I need more practice.


How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

It was great experience. My first pair Paul was incredibly nice. Whenever I could not understand something he always told me what to do nice way.  The guide was just right. She let us try first and whenever we skipped steps , she gently led us to right path.  I just thought I should be better than that so that the pair can learn something from me, too
