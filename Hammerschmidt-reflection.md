## GPS #1 Reflections

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
    * I was unsure of the way fetch and merge were used.
    * I also was unaware of how git clone-ing would affect the current directory.
* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
    - After doing a **git fetch** we saw the way Git named the temporary branch.  This allowed me to understand how **git merge** could then be used.
* What questions did you ask your pair and your guide?
    - I posed numerous questions to my pair so I can't remember anything specific.  I asked my guide how the directory is laid out when doing a git clone.
* What still confuses you about Git?
    - I'm unsure how exactly merge conflicts get resolved in each branch that's involved.
* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
    - It was great!  My pair and I had a vocal language barrier between us and were still able to communicate very effectively.  Perhaps programming code is able to bridge the gap...
